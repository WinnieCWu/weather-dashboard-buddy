## What it is
Weather Dashboard Buddy is an app that runs in the broswer and uses the OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities. Users can search for a preferred city, and see the 5-day weather condition for that city, such as its temperature, wind speed, and humidity. The search history will be saved and visible below the search form, so it can be easily accessed again.

## Technologies Used
This app features dynamically updated HTML and CSS through JavaScript. Additionally, it uses OpenWeather API to retrieve weather data and local storage to store persistent data, such as recently searched city names.
